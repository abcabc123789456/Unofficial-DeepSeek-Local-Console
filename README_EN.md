# DeepSeek Local Console (Unofficial)

[Simplified Chinese](README.md) | English

An unofficial, locally hosted DeepSeek chat console. The browser UI runs on your own machine, while the Node.js server only serves static assets, persists local state, and proxies requests to the DeepSeek API.

The code, UI, and documentation for this project were written entirely with OpenAI Codex.

This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by DeepSeek.

## Features

- Configure the API key and API base URL locally
- Manage multiple conversations, including deletion with confirmation
- New conversations inherit the current conversation model by default
- Stream responses and stop generation manually
- Display and collapse `reasoning_content` separately
- Render Markdown and KaTeX
- Use an Obsidian-like Markdown editing experience in the input area
- Store model, streaming mode, and request parameters per conversation
- Optionally fetch the model list from `/models`

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or later
- Network access to the DeepSeek API
- A valid DeepSeek API key

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Start

```bash
npm start
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

To use another port, set the `PORT` environment variable. For example, in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:PORT = "3001"
npm start
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3001/
```

## Local Data and Security

On first start, the app creates:

```text
data/store.json
```

This file stores local conversations, settings, and other state. If the user chooses to save the API key locally, the API key is also stored in plaintext in this file.

Do not publish, commit, or package the following local files and directories:

- `data/`
- `.env`, `.env.*`
- `node_modules/`
- `.git/`
- `.playwright-cli/`
- `output/`
- `*.zip`, `*.tar`, `*.tar.gz`
- log files

These paths are already covered by `.gitignore`. When redistributing source code, include only the source tree and required license notices, not personal conversation data or local archive files.

## Reinstall Dependencies

The repository does not include `node_modules/`. After cloning the source on a new machine, run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
